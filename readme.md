Owners can collect and comprehend Pet Data by analyzing raw information and presenting it in an easy to understand way. The Pet Tracker offers personalized pet information including location data, physical characteristics and owner information allowing pet owners to provide the best care for their pets. It can be used to improve the health of your pet by providing a total distance travelled and can also be used as an identification tool for lost cats with the Owner Information data. The Kitty Tracker product provides these features by combining two components. The first component is the "Collar Tracker" and the second component is the "Home Station".

The collar tracker is placed on the pet with a switch to control the logging patterns. It records the GPS location and time writing it to an SD Card for storage. The code for the collar portion is in the respository as I worked exclusively in my group on it.
